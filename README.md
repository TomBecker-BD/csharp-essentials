# C# Essentials and Best Practices

It is easy to write a trivial application in C#. For a non-trivial application, C# is full of unexpected gotchas. 
It really helps to know a few simple best practices so you can avoid the gotchas and write reliable, scalable code 
from the beginning. This project covers the essential C# best practices you need: resource management, properties, 
error handling, and exception-safe code.
